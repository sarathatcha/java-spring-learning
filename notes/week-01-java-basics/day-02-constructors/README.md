# Day 2 - Constructors

## What I learned
- Difference between class and object
- JVM calls main(), not me
- static is required for entry point

## Practice
- Created Person class
- Created multiple objects
- Observed separate memory allocation

## Key takeaway
A class is a blueprint. Objects are real instances.
